## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Hareesh9849/Diabetes-Prediction-ML
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the project:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
## Usage
To use the early stage diabetes prediction model:

Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Installation section.

Prepare your input data in the required format.

Load the trained model using the following code snippet:

python
Copy code
from diabetes_prediction import DiabetesPredictor

# Load the model
predictor = DiabetesPredictor.load_model("model.pkl")
Use the predictor to make predictions on new data:

python
Copy code
# Prepare new data
new_data = ...  # Your input data

# Make predictions
predictions = predictor.predict(new_data)

# Print the predictions
print(predictions)
Feel free to provide more specific instructions or code examples based on your project's implementation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the early stage diabetes prediction model is not publicly available due to privacy concerns and data usage agreements. However, you can find similar datasets on platforms like Kaggle or by contacting healthcare institutions or research organizations.

## Model Training
The early stage diabetes prediction model was trained using machine learning techniques, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. The training process involved the following steps:

Preprocessing the dataset, which included handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Training multiple machine learning models using the training set and optimizing their hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.

Evaluating the models on the testing set and selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Saving the trained model for future use.

For more details, refer to the Model Training section of the README or the source code.

## Evaluation
The performance of the early stage diabetes prediction model was evaluated using standard evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model was also compared against baseline models or existing approaches to assess its effectiveness in predicting early stage diabetes.

For detailed evaluation results, refer to the Evaluation section of the README or the documentation.
